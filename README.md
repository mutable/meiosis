## Naming Components

When creating new component tags, we recommend _not_ using `stencil` in the component name (ex: `<stencil-datepicker>`). This is because the generated component has little to nothing to do with Stencil; it's just a web component!

Instead, use a prefix that fits your company or any name for a group of related components. For example, all of the Ionic generated web components use the prefix `ion`.


## Using this component

There are three strategies we recommend for using web components built with Stencil.

The first step for all three of these strategies is to [publish to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

### Script tag

- Put a script tag similar to this `<script src='https://unpkg.com/my-component@0.0.1/dist/mycomponent.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### Node Modules
- Run `npm install my-component --save`
- Put a script tag similar to this `<script src='node_modules/my-component/dist/mycomponent.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### In a stencil-starter app
- Run `npm install my-component --save`
- Add an import to the npm packages `import my-component;`
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc
